Serverless Microservice to send SMS (API Gateway + Usage plan + SNS)

Project goals:
- Use as much as possible directly AWSâ€™s services integration: connect AWS Api Gateway right with AWS SNS with no AWS Lambda needed in between.
- Protect the service endpoint with an API Key regulated with an Usage Plan
